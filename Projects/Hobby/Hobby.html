        <p id="first">
            Hello there! My name is Salvador and I would like to show you how to make your money "work" to grow you finaical status using our "Mano-A-Mano Sytem" that has been working for millions of people in the world! I grew up working 10-12hrs shifts getting paid by the hour. One day I told myself "this lifestyle is not for me. I need to come up with a way to make money and help my comunity do the same." Welcome to my hobby, creating oppoortunities for my comunity to prosper!

            Have you ever wondered how the rich get richer? Have you ever asked someone how did they get so wealthy? I was always fascinated by the fact that many people think money is easy and you should always have multiple incomes to be successful financially speaking. After reading several books and after listening to several mentor I noticed that you need three things to be successful.
           <ul>
               <li>Take Risk</li>
                <li>Have a positive outlook</li>
                <li>Learn</li>
           </ul> 
            My hobby consists of creating different ways to help my community prosper. Here is one system that I discovered to help you improve your finacial stability.

            This is a stepstone method that has been around for years! The way it works is by filling in the spaces with people that are interested on joining the first level. Depending on how much you are commited and how much are you will to pay to play every group has a different pyramid.
        </p>
        <h2> Level 1</h2>
        <p>Here is the entry level 1. You will find out how much you will need to pay and how amny people will need to get involved so you could get paid faster. If you have any question this is the time to get them answered. Serval of people who have join will be more than willing to explain their gains in this system as well.</p>

        <h2>Level 2</h2>
        <p>Here in level 2 there are 4 spots to fill. We ask for people who joined “Mano a Mano” to try and find at least 2 people that they know to get involve and help them sing up so that when they join they fill level 1 so that once level one gets filled everyone will be able to push up a level. Key note; You should already have at least two people in mind that you know they will join and you will feel great to showcase this opportunity.</p>

        <h2>Level 3</h2>
        <p>Here in level 3 there are 2 spots to fill. In this level we ask that you keep in touch with the people that you added in level 2 and motivate them to fill in the necessary spaces in level 1 so that everyone can once again push up and enter the next level. Also, we reccomend that you host meeting with your team to come up with different strategies that could help you progress the pyramid faster.</p>

        <h2>Level 4</h2>
        <p>Here in this level we call it the payout level. Once you are on the top of the pyramid it is your turn to help make the last push and fill level 1 because once this row gets filled you get paid the amount you initially started x8. For example if you entered with $25 your payout would be $200! This does depend on what pyramid you join and you see how many people you will need to get paid. </p>
